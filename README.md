Click on an image to earn points, but don't click on any more than once!

#Instructions

-The application keeps track of the player's score. 

-The player's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time.

-The player's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

-Every time an image is clicked, the images will shuffle themselves in a random order.

-If the player's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
